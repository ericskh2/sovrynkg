There were so many moving pieces and I didn't understand how they all fit together just from the documentation.  Clicking around in the RSK block explorer I found a lot of data was given as `raw_log_topics` or lengthy address strings.  Being able to visualize how the various contracts and calls fit together has been very helpful."
